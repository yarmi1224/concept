Contact release capsule useful for chemical mechanical planarization slurry","
The invention relates to a contact release capsule comprising a particle, a chemical payload, and a polymer coating, wherein the particle is impregnated with the chemical payload, and the chemical payload is held inside the particle by the polymer coating until the contact release capsule contacts a surface and a shearing force removes the polymer coating allowing the chemical payload to release outside the particle.The contact release capsule is useful in chemical mechanical planarization slurries.Particularly, the contact release capsule may comprise a glycine impregnated silica nanoparticle coated with a polymer, wherein the contact release capsule is dispersed in an aqueous solution and used in the copper chemical mechanical planarization process.Use of the contact release capsule in a slurry for copper chemical mechanical planarization may significantly improve planarization efficiency, decrease unwanted etching and corrosion, and improve dispersion stability.

Chemical-mechanical polishing of sic surfaces using hydrogen peroixde or ozonated water solutions in combination with colloidal abrasive","
A process is taught for producing a smooth, damage-free surface on a SiC wafer, suitable for subsequent epitaxial film growth or ion implantation and semiconductor device fabrication.The process uses certain oxygenated solutions in combination with a colloidal abrasive in order to remove material from the wafer surface in a controlled manner.Hydrogen peroxide with or without ozonated water, in combination with colloidal silica or alumina (or alternatively, in combination with HF to affect the oxide removal) is the preferred embodiment of the invention.The invention also provides a means to monitor the sub-surface damage depth and extent since it initially reveals this damage though the higher oxidation rate and the associated higher removal rate.

Disclosed is a method of forming a copper wiring in a semiconductor device.A copper layer buries a damascene pattern in which an interlayer insulating film of a low dielectric constant.The copper layer is polished by means of a chemical mechanical polishing process to form a copper wiring within a damascene pattern.At this time, the chemical mechanical polishing process is overly performed so that the top surface of the copper wiring is concaved and is lower than the surface of the interlayer insulating film of the low dielectric constant neighboring it.Furthermore, an annealing process is performed so that the top surface of the copper wiring is changed from the concaved shape to a convex shape while stabilizing the copper wiring.A copper anti-diffusion insulating film is then formed on the entire structure including the top surface of the copper wiring having the convex shape.As such, the copper anti-diffusion insulating film is formed not only within the damascene pattern but also on the entire structure, thus serving as a barrier to prohibit electro-migration and stress migration of copper.It is thus possible to improve reliability of the wiring.In addition, the entire surface including the top surface of the copper wiring is polished without a step to facilitate a photolithography process, an etch process, etc. that are subsequently performed.It is therefore possible to improve reliability in process.",H01L-021/3205,Process,anneal process,0.030840744

A novel copper damascene method for making metal interconnections on semiconductor integrated circuits was achieved.This method avoids overpolishing into a low-k dielectric fluorine-doped glass which would cause copper-flake defects resulting in intralevel electrical shorts.The method utilizes a stacked hard-mask layer on the doped glass layer consisting of a first polish-stop layer, a sacrificial insulating layer and an upper second polish-stop layer.After etching trenches in the stacked hard-mask layer and the doped glass, a copper layer is deposited to fill the trenches and is polished back to the second polish-stop layer.The high polish-back selectivity of the copper to the second polish-stop layer results in improved polish-back uniformity across the substrate.The relatively thin second polish-stop layer can then be polished back and partially into the sacrificial layer without overpolishing and damaging the underlying first polish-stop layer.The sacrificial layer is then removed to complete a level of metal interconnections.The method can be repeated to complete the multilevel of interconnections.",H01L-021/311,Apparatus,carbid deposit plasmaenhanc,0.005741153

Method for chemical-mechanical planarization of a substrate on a fixed-abrasive polishing pad","
A method for chemical-mechanical planarization of a substrate on a fixed-abrasive polishing pad in which a planarizing solution is dispensed onto the fixed-abrasive polishing pad.The planarizing solution is preferably an abrasive-free planarizing solution that oxidizes a surface layer on the substrate without passing the surface layer into solution, and the fixed-abrasive pad has a substantially uniform distribution of abrasive particles fixedly bonded to a suspension medium.The surface layer of the substrate is then pressed against the fixed-abrasive pad in the presence of planarizing solution, and at least one of the fixed-abrasive pad or the substrate moves relative to the other to remove material from the surface of the substrate.In operation, the planarizing solution forms a rough, scabrous layer of non-soluble oxides on the surface layer that are readily removed by the abrasive surface of the polishing pad.In one embodiment of the invention, the pH of the planarizing solution is controlled to oxidize the material of the surface layer without passing it into solution.
